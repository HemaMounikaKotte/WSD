      <p> The resulting temperature change by the year 2100 is around 0.5°C, and it basically represents the thermal inertia of the coupled land/ocean/atmosphere system.
          It works out to about 35 years. (Readers of these pages will recall that we achieved the same number without a climate model way back in 2001. The related scientific reference is at the end of this article.)
          So all we have to do is cut emissions back to 2000 levels, right? Wrongo. This result holds only if atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases remain at 2000 levels, which is impossible.</p>

      <p>For example, let’s cut the world’s CO2 emissions by 10 percent in the next couple of years. we see that a 10% reduction gets us somewhere to around the emissions levels of 1991, And  we see that 1991 levels of CO2 emissions resulted in an annual atmospheric CO2 concentration increase of about 1.6 ppm/yr.
          From Table, we see that by the year 2100 that this increase will result in CO2 levels of about 530ppm and an approximate temperature rise of about 1.47ºC by 2100. </p>
