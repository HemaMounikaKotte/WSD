      <p> The resulting temperature change by the year 2100 is around 0.5Â°C, and it basically represents the thermal inertia of the coupled land/ocean/atmosphere system.
          It works out to about 35 years. (Readers of these pages will recall that we achieved the same number without a climate model way back in 2001. The related scientific reference is at the end of this article.)
          So all we have to do is cut emissions back to 2000 levels, right? Wrongo. This result holds only if atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases remain at 2000 levels, which is impossible.</p>
